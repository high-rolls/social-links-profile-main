## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned how to use the Screen Ruler application in Windows PowerToys. That was very useful to quickly check the sizes and spacings of elements.

I'm also using `min-height: 100dvh` in the **body** element. Hopefully that fixes some mobile browser quirks, I've yet to test it.

### Continued development

I want to learn how to simplify the process of writing styles. I was thinking of using Tailwind for this one, but decided to keep it pure.
